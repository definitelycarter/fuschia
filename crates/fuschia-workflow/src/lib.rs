//! Fuschia Workflow
//!
//! This crate provides the "locked" workflow representation for Fuschia.
//! A locked workflow is a validated, resolved form of a workflow configuration
//! that is ready for execution.
//!
//! Key differences from `fuschia-config`:
//! - Graph structure is validated (no orphans, valid edges)
//! - Components are referenced by digest (content-addressable)
//! - Entry points and join points are identified
//! - Ready to be dispatched to workers for execution
