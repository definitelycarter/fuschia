//! Fuscia Config
//!
//! This crate contains the serializable workflow configuration types for Fuscia.
//! These types represent workflow definitions before they are loaded and resolved
//! by the engine.
//!
//! Configuration can be loaded from:
//! - JSON files (via CLI with `--config=workflow.json`)
//! - Database storage (as JSON blobs)
//!
//! The engine takes these configuration types, validates them against component
//! schemas, and resolves them into runtime structures for execution.
