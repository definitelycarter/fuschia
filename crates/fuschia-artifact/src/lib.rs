//! Fuscia Artifact
//!
//! This crate provides the artifact storage trait and implementations for Fuscia.
//! Artifacts are binary blobs (images, files, large data) that are stored separately
//! from workflow execution data.
//!
//! The [`Store`] trait defines the platform/backend layer for artifact storage.
//! Implementations handle the actual storage (filesystem, S3, etc.) while the
//! engine translates artifact IDs to storage keys.
//!
//! The trait uses async streaming for efficient handling of large files.
