/// Glue between [`WasmActor`](crate::WasmActor) and a host-specific wasm world.
///
/// A `WasmHost` impl owns the world-specific concerns — generated bindings,
/// per-Store state, linker wiring, and the trampolines that call the
/// component's lifecycle exports (`setup`, `handle`, `teardown`). The actor
/// crate provides the channel loop and lifecycle orchestration; the host
/// fills in the world-specific gaps.
///
/// Fuchsia ships [`DefaultHost`](crate::DefaultHost) for the canonical
/// `actor-component` world (log + http + emit). Hosts with additional
/// capabilities (MQTT, BLE, etc.) define their own WIT world and implement
/// `WasmHost` for the corresponding bindgen output.
